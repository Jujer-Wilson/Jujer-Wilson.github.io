Once you’re done, tap the ‘close’ button to stop the camera and go back to the home screen.</p><p>With these easy steps, you can easily scan a QR code on your Android phone without an app and get the information you need.</p><h3 id=--preparing-the-camera>- Preparing the Camera<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#--preparing-the-camera>#</a></h3><p>QR codes have been used for the last couple of years since they were first developed in the early 90s. They are one of the most convenient means of sharing and exchanging information quickly. If you don’t have a QR code app installed on your device, you can still manually scan a QR code with your Android mobile without downloading an app.</p><p>First, open the camera app on your device and point it towards the QR code. Make sure your camera focuses on the QR code, so it scans it correctly. When the camera has successfully scanned the code, the permission page will pop up. Tap “Allow” to grant the app access to your device.</p><p>Now you can access the content of the QR code. It could be a website link, text, contact details, images, etc. If it is a website link, it will automatically redirect you to the website. Text will be viewable in the camera app itself. However, if it is a contact detail, an alert will appear, providing you with an option to save the contact by tapping “Add.”</p><p>For images, they can be saved on your device just like a photo. All you need to do is tap the download icon, which appears when you point the camera at the QR code. Once you save the image, it can be viewed in the photo gallery just like any other photos.</p><p>With these steps, you can manually scan a QR code without an app on your Android mobile. It is a simple and effective way to access the information stored in the QR code.</p><h3 id=--scanning-the-qr-code>- Scanning the QR Code<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#--scanning-the-qr-code>#</a></h3><p>QR codes are the small squares with black and white patterns that contain information in a small form. On Android devices it is possible to scan these codes without downloading a specific app. Here’s our guide to scanning a QR code on your Android mobile without an app.</p><p>First, open the camera on your Android mobile. Place the QR code in front of the camera. You will now be able to see the code on the screen. Then, tap the banner notification that appears at the top of the screen and it will display the information stored in the QR code.</p><p>On some devices, the QR code scanner may not appear when you open the camera. In this case, you need to open the settings in the camera app and activate the QR code reader. You can do this by going to the camera settings and turning the “QR code reader” option to “On”.</p><p>Once you have enabled the QR code scanner, you can scan the QR codes you encounter. Place the code in front of the camera and wait until it scans the code. Finally, tap the notification banner that appears at the top of the screen and you will be able to view the information stored in the code.</p><p>Scanning QR codes without downloading any apps is a great way to save time and storage on your Android device.

You can use this to download the app or open the website. Additionally, if an app is linked to the QR code, it will appear directly in the Google Play Store for you to install.</p><p>To make it even easier, you can also store QR codes for websites you visit regularly, or save them to your camera roll. You can then open these at any time, without needing to scan the code every time.</p><p>Finally, it’s important to remember that scanning QR codes can be risky. Be sure to check the source of the code before scanning it and only open websites or apps from trusted sources.
