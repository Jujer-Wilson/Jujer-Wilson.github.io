We’ll show you how to quickly delete all emails from your Gmail inbox, as well as how to delete specific emails from your Android device.\nTo delete all emails in one go on your Android phone, open the Gmail app and tap the menu icon in the top left corner. From here, select ‘All mail’ which can be seen under the ‘All labels’ section. All your emails should now be loaded on the screen. You can choose to delete all emails by tapping the three vertically aligned dots in the top right corner and selecting ‘Delete all’.\nIf you only want to delete specific emails from your inbox, you’ll need to use the ‘Multiple select’ option.

Accessing Bulk Delete Settings on Gmail<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-accessing-bulk-delete-settings-on-gmail>#</a></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re dealing with a large amount of Gmail emails on your Android device, bulk-deleting them can save time and make the process much simpler. We&rsquo;ll show you how to quickly delete all emails from your Gmail inbox, as well as how to delete specific emails from your Android device.</p><p>To delete all emails in one go on your Android phone, open the Gmail app and tap the menu icon in the top left corner. From here, select ‘All mail&rsquo; which can be seen under the ‘All labels&rsquo; section. All your emails should now be loaded on the screen. You can choose to delete all emails by tapping the three vertically aligned dots in the top right corner and selecting ‘Delete all&rsquo;.</p><p>If you only want to delete specific emails from your inbox, you&rsquo;ll need to use the ‘Multiple select&rsquo; option. To do so, tap the ‘Select&rsquo; icon in the top right corner and select the emails you want to delete. You can either choose to delete all emails from one sender or multiple emails from different senders. Once you&rsquo;re done, tap the ‘Delete&rsquo; icon at the top of the screen.</p><p>Gmail also offers options for archiving, rather than deleting, emails from your inbox. To use this option, simply click the ‘Archive&rsquo; icon at the top of the screen after selecting the emails you want to archive. Archiving emails makes them easier to find later on, as they will not be deleted but instead sent to the ‘Archive&rsquo; folder.</p><p>Finally, you can also set up filters on your Gmail account to automatically delete emails from certain senders. To do so, open the ‘Settings&rsquo; tab in the Gmail app and select ‘Filters and blocked addresses&rsquo;.
