The key is to be familiar with the two primary methods of taking screenshots. The button combination method is the traditional way for taking screenshots on iPhones, but iPhones XS Max have another option with the AssistiveTouch feature. Here is a step-by-step guide for taking screenshots on an iPhone XS Max.</p><p>First, press the Sleep/Wake (top right) and Home (bottom center) buttons simultaneously. This will trigger the screenshot effect with a white flash on the iPhone’s display. If successful, you will hear the shutter sound and the screenshot will be saved to the Photos app on the iPhone.</p><p>Alternatively, the AssistiveTouch feature allows you to take screenshots with just one hand. To enable this feature, go to Settings > General > Accessibility and toggle on AssistiveTouch. You can now access AssistiveTouch through the AssistiveTouch icon that appears on the iPhone XS Max&rsquo;s display. Now tap Device > More > Screenshot. This will trigger the screenshot effect and save the photo to the Photos app.</p><p>Taking screenshots on iPhones XS Max is now easier than ever with these two methods. The traditional button combination method allows you to take screenshots quickly while the AssistiveTouch feature is useful for taking screenshots one-handed. With the right method, taking screenshots on iPhones XS Max is easy and quick.</p><h2 id=3-what-to-do-after-taking-a-screenshot-on-iphone-xs-max>3.
