To take a screenshot, you simply press the “Windows key + PrtScn” keys simultaneously, and the screenshot will then be saved to your Screenshots folder in the Pictures library.\nAccording to a report published by Statista, an estimated 143 million Windows 8.1 users are currently using Windows 8.1 operating system on their laptops and other devices. This means that taking screenshots on Windows 8.1 laptops is a popular task that many users are likely to need help with.\n“Taking screenshots of your laptop on Windows 8.1 is a great way to quickly capture information that you need to reference later or share with others,” said tech expert Robert Rogers. “Having the ability to quickly take a screenshot and then edit it, which is also possible with Windows 8.1, can save you time in the long run.”\n- Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with the Keyboard Layout Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with the Keyboard Layout. To take a screenshot on your Windows 8.1 HP laptop, the first thing to do is to take a look at the keyboard layout. You should look for the Function (Fn) key and then locate the PrtSc key. This key is used to take a screenshot on your Windows 8.1 HP laptop. It is usually located near the other F keys. Once you know where the Fn and PrtSc keys are located, you can move on to the next step.\nSub Judul: Knowing how to take screenshot in Windows 8.1 in HP laptop can be useful in many situations. One of the first and most important steps you need to do is to become familiar with the layout of the keyboard, as this will determine how you will take a screenshot. Press and hold the [Windows] button on the laptop’s keyboard, then press the PrtScn (or Print Screen) button. This should capture a screenshot of the entire screen and save it to a file on your PC. Alternatively, you can press the [Alt]+[PrtScn] keys, which will capture a screenshot of just the active window on the screen and save it to a file. Finally, press the [Windows] + [Shift] + [S] keys to launch the built-in Snipping Tool and select the area of the screen you wish to capture. This should save the screenshot of the selected area to a file on your PC.\n1. Understanding the Keyboard Layout Taking a screenshot in Windows 8.1 can be a bit of a challenge if you’re unfamiliar with the keyboard layout. Fortunately, Windows 8.1 allows you to take a screenshot with just a few keyboard shortcuts. The first step is to familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout. The Print Screen key is typically located in the upper-right corner of the keyboard and is labeled either PrtScn or PrtSc. Pressing this key alone will capture a screenshot of your entire screen and copy it to the clipboard. You can then paste the image onto any other program, such as Microsoft Paint, in order to save it. Alternatively, you can press the Fn + PrtScn keys to take a screenshot of just the active window. Finally, you can press Alt + PrtScn to take a screenshot and save it as a file on your computer. With these steps, taking a screenshot of your Windows 8.1 hp laptop should be a breeze.\n2. Taking a Screenshot on Windows 8.1 HP Laptop The first step in learning how to take a screenshot in Windows 8.1 on a HP laptop is to familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout. You need to know which keys are the Windows key, Print Screen key, and the Alt key. The Windows key is the key with the Windows logo on it and is usually located on the bottom left of the keyboard. The Print Screen key is usually found towards the top right of the keyboard and is labeled with the words PrtScn or PrtSc. Lastly, the Alt key is one of the two keys located on either side of the spacebar.\n- Step 2: Open the Snipping Tool Step 2: Open the Snipping Tool. To open the Snipping Tool, just type “snipping tool” in the search bar on the far left side of the screen. Once the Snipping Tool appears in the list of search results, choose it to open it. The Snipping Tool window should appear on the screen. From there, you can choose the type of screenshot you want to take. Choose from Free-Form Snip, Rectangular Snip, Window Snip, or Full-Screen Snip. Click the type of snip you want to take and its respective button to select it. Then, drag your cursor over the area of the screen you want to capture, and click the Save icon to save the screenshot.\n1. Opening the Snipping Tool In order to take a screenshot in Window 8.1 of your HP laptop, the first step is to open the Snipping Tool. This can be done by simply searching for “Snipping Tool” from the Start screen, and it will appear in the search results. After opening the tool, you are allowed to select the type of snip you want to make. You can choose from Rectangular, Free-form, Window, and Full-screen under the New option. Once you have finished choosing the type of snip, you will be able to drag your mouse to select the portion of the screen you want to capture. After completing the selection, you will now be able to see your screenshot on the window in the Snipping Tool. You can now save your screenshot by pressing the save button. To save your screenshot, just choose the desired format and file location. You can save your screenshot in the following formats: .html, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png and .mht. Click the save button again and your screenshot will be saved to the location you’ve chosen. Finally, you are all set to use the screenshot you have taken. This is how to take a screenshot in Windows 8.1 of your HP laptop. With these steps, you will be able to capture any screenshot you want in an easier way.\n2. Taking Screenshots on a Windows 8.1 HP Laptop Once you have identified the image or text you want to capture, the next step is to open the Snipping Tool. It is located in the Windows Accessories folder on your computer. Navigate to the Start Menu, click All Programs, select Accessories and locate the Snipping Tool from the list. Once the tool is opened, you can begin taking screenshots by clicking the New button in the tool. You can choose from several snipping selection options, including rectangular, free-form, and window and full-screen selections. You can also edit the screenshot using the Snipping Tool’s annotation options. After you have captured the screenshot, you can save it as an image file or copy it to the clipboard.\n- Step 3: Use the PrntScr Button The third step to taking a screenshot on a Windows 8.1 HP laptop is the use of the PrntScr button. This button is found in the top of the keyboard, usually between the F12 and Scroll Lock. Pressing this button will immediately take a screenshot of the whole screen - the same as pressing the Print Screen key. The screenshot will be stored in the clipboard, which can be accessed from the paste button. Users can then paste it in an image-editing program or other applications to save the image.\nI.

You can then paste it to an image editing program such as Microsoft Paint, or open the Snipping Tool which is a utility included with Windows for taking screenshots.\na. Using the PrntScr button Once you are ready with everything, use the PrtScr button. This is a specific key located on the right side of your laptop keyboard with the letters PRTSC displayed on it.

Once you have edited the image, you can save it at any chosen location in your HP laptop.\nb.

The PrtScr button is usually located on the top row of your keyboard, between the F12 and the Scroll Lock key. The screenshot taken will automatically be copied to the clipboard, so you can open your preferred image editor and paste the screenshot for saving it. If you have multiple monitors, the PrtScr will capture all of them at once.\nIf you want to capture only the active window, press the Alt + PrtScr keys together. This will capture an image of only the active window, and it will be copied to the clipboard. Paste the image to your image editor and save it.\nYou can also use the Windows snipping tool to capture a screenshot and save it. Click on the Start menu, type snipping tool and click on it to open the Snipping tool menu. Choose the rectangular snip option and you can drag around the area to capture the screenshot.\nTo capture a portion of the screen, press the Windows key + Shift + S. This will open a small snipping menu at the top of your screen and you can select an area to capture. The screenshot will be copied to the clipboard. Paste the image to your image editor and save it.\n- Step 4: Use the Keyboard Shortcut Once you have all the settings adjusted for your screenshot, you can use the keyboard shortcut to take it. On Windows 8.1 HP laptops, the shortcut is Alt + PrtScn. To use it, simply press and hold down the Alt key and press the PrtScn key at the same time. You’ll then see an image of your current screen saved in the Screenshots folder in the Pictures library. From there, you can edit or upload the screenshot to share it with others.\n1. Understanding the Keyboard Shortcut Press the Windows key and ‘PrntScrn’ key simultaneously to take a screenshot. Your screenshot will be saved to the ‘Screenshots’ folder which is located in your Pictures folder. The file will be labeled as ‘Screenshot (number)’. For example, if this is the first screenshot you took, the file will be labeled as ‘Screenshot (1)’. You can rename it easily by right-clicking and selecting ‘Rename’.

You can access the folder by opening the Photos app, selecting the Pictures library, and then clicking on the Screenshots folder. From there, you can open and edit the screenshots as desired.\n- Step 5: Crop and Save the Screenshot Once you have taken the screenshot, you’re now ready to crop and save it. To do this, open the screenshot you just took with your favorite image editor. Now, use the crop tool to select only the part of the image that you want to keep. Adjust the size and shape of the crop box to perfectly select the area of the screenshot you wish to keep. When you are done, click on the crop button to apply the changes. Finally, save the screenshot to the desired location in the desired format. You have now successfully captured and saved the screenshot on your Windows 8.1 HP laptop.\n1.Gathering the Necessary Tools Once you have taken the screenshot, you can do some basic edits and save the image.

You can then click and drag the mouse to select the area that you want to keep, and click ‘Save As’ button to save the screenshot. You can also manually adjust the selection box to fit the area which you want to save. Once you are done, click ‘Crop’ button and the screenshot will be saved. Finally, you can save it in any format you prefer such as JPG, PNG, or GIF.\n2.Taking the Screenshot Once you’ve identified the area you want to capture, you’ll need to crop and save the screenshot.

Once you’ve selected the area to capture, click the Save Snip button to save the screenshot to a file. You can then use the file to paste the screenshot into any other application.

Understanding the Keyboard Layout<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-understanding-the-keyboard-layout>#</a></h3><p>Taking a screenshot in Windows 8.1 can be a bit of a challenge if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the keyboard layout. Fortunately, Windows 8.1 allows you to take a screenshot with just a few keyboard shortcuts. The first step is to familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout.

Pressing this key alone will capture a screenshot of your entire screen and copy it to the clipboard. You can then paste the image onto any other program, such as Microsoft Paint, in order to save it. Alternatively, you can press the Fn + PrtScn keys to take a screenshot of just the active window. Finally, you can press Alt + PrtScn to take a screenshot and save it as a file on your computer. With these steps, taking a screenshot of your Windows 8.1 hp laptop should be a breeze.</p><h3 id=2-taking-a-screenshot-on-windows-81-hp-laptop>2.
