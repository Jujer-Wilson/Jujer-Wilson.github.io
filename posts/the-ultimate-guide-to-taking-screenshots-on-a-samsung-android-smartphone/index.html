Most Samsung phones have the ability to capture a screenshot with a press of two buttons. Here is a brief guide to help you take a screenshot on your Samsung Android phone.</p><p>First, press and hold the volume down button and the power button simultaneously. You will know that you have succeeded if you hear a shutter sound and see a little animation on the screen. Your screenshot will then be automatically saved in the &lsquo;Screenshots&rsquo; folder in the Gallery.</p><p>Once you have successfully taken the screenshot, you can edit it accordingly. Some Samsung phones come with screenshot editing tools and features, making customizing your screenshot easier.
