On Android devices, you can turn on the Bluetooth by going to the Settings menu and then, to Network and Internet. Once you have paired the two devices, you can initiate the transfer by selecting the files you want to share. On the iPhone, you can find the Bluetooth settings in the Control Center. After the transfer is complete, you can check the files in the respective device&rsquo;s Internal Storage. With these simple steps, you can easily transfer data between an Android and iPhone via Bluetooth.</p><h3 id=1-enable-bluetooth-on-both-devices>1.
