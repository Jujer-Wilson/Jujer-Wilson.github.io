The iPhone XR comes with a great feature for taking long screenshots. It can be done in 4 simple steps. Step 1 is to take the first screenshot. Just hold down the power and volume up buttons simultaneously, and the screenshot will be taken. Step 2 is to capture additional screenshots. With each additional screenshot, tap the &lsquo;right arrow&rsquo; icon to the left of the screenshot in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Step 3 is to put the multiple screenshots together. All of the screenshots will be combined into one long image. The last step is to save the screenshot.

And you&rsquo;re done!</p><h3 id=step-3-combine-multiple-screenshots-into-one>Step 3: Combine Multiple Screenshots into One<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-3-combine-multiple-screenshots-into-one>#</a></h3><p>Taking long screenshots on iPhone XR doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult.
