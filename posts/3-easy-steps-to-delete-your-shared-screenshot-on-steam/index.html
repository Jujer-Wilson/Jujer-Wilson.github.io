Deleting the Shared Screenshot<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-deleting-the-shared-screenshot>#</a></h3><p>If you are an avid Steam user, then you might have shared a screenshot of your screen on Steam. But after some time, you might want to delete the shared screenshot due to it containing sensitive information. This article will provide you step-by-step instructions on how to delete the shared screenshot on Steam.
First, you will need to open your Steam client and log in. Once you are logged in, look for the “View” option located at the top of your screen. Hover your mouse over it and click on “Screenshots”. You will be able to see all the screenshots that you have shared on your Steam account.
Second, click on the screenshot that you would like to delete. On the right side of the screenshot, you will see the “Delete” option. Click on it and a confirmation window will appear. Click on “Yes” to confirm the deletion.
Third, after you have clicked on “Yes”, a message will appear saying that the screenshot has been deleted. You can then close the window and your screenshot will no longer be visible on the Steam client.
Finally, it is important to note that once you have deleted the screenshot, it cannot be undone or recovered. You can always re-upload the screenshot but it will not overwrite the deleted version. So make sure to think twice before deleting the shared screenshot on Steam.</p><h2 id=3-how-to-disable-the-feature-to-re-share-the-screenshot>3.

Understanding the Feature<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-understanding-the-feature>#</a></h3><p>Taking screenshots in Steam games is a great way to capture your gaming memories. However, players who have shared their screenshots with the Steam Community should be aware that anyone can re-share your screenshot again and again without your permission. If you want to get rid of this possibility, here is how to disable the feature to re-share the screenshot on Steam.</p><p>Firstly, launch Steam on your desktop. Find the View menu located at the top and click on Settings from the drop-down list. Then, select the In-Game tab and make sure that the Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game option is checked. Click on “OK” when you are done.</p><p>Next, open My Profile from the Steam library. Scroll down to the Screenshots tab. Select all the screenshots that you want to restrict from re-sharing by clicking on them. Under the “Public” section, uncheck the Allow anyone to view my screenshots in the Steam Community box.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished, click on the Save button. Now, all the selected screenshots can only be viewed by users who have access to your profile. If someone tries to re-share any of them, it will appear broken as a result of the restriction.</p><p>In conclusion, by following these steps, you can easily disable the feature to re-share the screenshot in Steam. This will help you protect your screenshots from being shared without your permission.</p><h3 id=2-disabling-the-feature>2. Disabling the Feature<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-disabling-the-feature>#</a></h3><p>In today&rsquo;s age of technology, sharing screenshots from your Steam account is a great way to keep your friends and family updated with the latest games or let them know that you are having fun with them. However, it can be a bit too much if you are sharing too many screenshots or they are being shared with people you don&rsquo;t really want to share them with. If you want to disable the feature to re-share the screenshots, here are some simple steps to do it.</p><p>First of all, you&rsquo;ll need to access your Steam account and go to the settings page. In here you can find the &lsquo;Screenshots and Broadcast&rsquo; section. Click on it and you&rsquo;ll see the option to disable the share feature. This will prevent others from re-sharing the screenshots from your Steam account.</p><p>The next step is to go to the &lsquo;Privacy Settings&rsquo; section in your Steam account. In here, you can choose to delete any shared screenshots from your Steam account. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, all shared screenshots will be deleted, ensuring that no one else can see them, no matter how they try.</p><p>Finally, if someone does manage to get a screenshot of your Steam account, you can flag it as inappropriate. In the &lsquo;Account Settings&rsquo; section, you can find the &lsquo;Flag Screenshots&rsquo; button. Once you&rsquo;ve clicked on this, Steam will review the screenshot before taking action.</p><p>By following these steps, you can make sure that you have complete control over who sees your Steam screenshots. You can disable the feature to re-share the screenshots and delete any that are already out there. If someone manages to get a screenshot of your Steam account, you can flag it as inappropriate and Steam will take the necessary action.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5pLVQhfQl8 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
