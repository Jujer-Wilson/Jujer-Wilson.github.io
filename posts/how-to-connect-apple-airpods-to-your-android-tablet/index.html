With the right combination of accessories, you can pair AirPods with your Android tablet and enjoy the same sound quality you would from any other Apple device. To find out which Android devices work with AirPods, read on.\nThe good news is that most newer Android tablets use Bluetooth, the same wireless technology that connects AirPods to their Apple device.

The same goes for tablets that don’t have a headphone jack.

Compatible Android Devices for AirPods<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-compatible-android-devices-for-airpods>#</a></h3><p>Apple AirPods are designed to be used with Apple devices, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t use them with your Android tablet. With the right combination of accessories, you can pair AirPods with your Android tablet and enjoy the same sound quality you would from any other Apple device. To find out which Android devices work with AirPods, read on.</p><p>The good news is that most newer Android tablets use Bluetooth, the same wireless technology that connects AirPods to their Apple device.

Once you have the adapter, you can connect your AirPods and enjoy your music, movies, and more.</p><p>Of course, if you have an older Android tablet that doesn&rsquo;t support Bluetooth, it won&rsquo;t work with AirPods.
