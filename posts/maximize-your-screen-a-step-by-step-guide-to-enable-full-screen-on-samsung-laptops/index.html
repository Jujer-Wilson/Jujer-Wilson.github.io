Achieving Full Screen Mode on Your Laptop<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-achieving-full-screen-mode-on-your-laptop>#</a></h3><p>Achieving full screen on a Samsung laptop can be a challenging task. However, it is possible to do it by following a few simple instructions. First, press the fn key and the F4 key simultaneously. This will maximize the window to take up the entire screen. If that does not work, try pressing the Windows key and the up arrow key at the same time. This will also cause the window to expand to fill the entire screen. If both steps fail, accessing the display settings in the control panel may be necessary. Select the Screen Resolution tab and select the Full Screen option. Click Apply and then OK to save the settings. Following these instructions will guarantee that the full screen option is enabled on your Samsung laptop.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZrtvghyUUU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How do I maximize my screen on a Samsung laptop?</p><p>A1: To maximize your screen on a Samsung laptop, you need to enable full screen.
