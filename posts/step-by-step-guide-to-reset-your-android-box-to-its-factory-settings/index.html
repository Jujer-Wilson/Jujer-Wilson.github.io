If this doesn’t solve the problem then you should restart your device and see if this helps in any way.\nIf you’re having trouble with device or app performance, you should check for any system updates that may be available. If there are any available, you should install them. If after updating your device, you still experience performance issues, it may be best to reset your device and start fresh.\nIf after resetting your device, you notice any new issues such as missing data, wiping the cache partition may help.

This should help clear out any corrupt data and improve performance.\nHopefully, this article has helped guide you through the process of troubleshooting any issues that may occur after resetting your Android box.
