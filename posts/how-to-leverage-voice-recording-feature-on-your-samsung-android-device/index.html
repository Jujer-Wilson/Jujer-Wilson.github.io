Recording Quality Voice on Your Android Device<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-recording-quality-voice-on-your-android-device>#</a></h3><p>Voice recording is an essential part of life in the modern world and it’s no different if you own a Samsung Android device. Recording quality sound with your phone or tablet is easy if you know the right steps. Here we’ll tell you how to record clear voice sound on your Samsung mobile.</p><p>First, make sure you have the right equipment. Headphones are essential for getting the best results as they help to isolate the microphone from any background noise. If you’re going to be recording on the go, a mini-boom mic is a great option. It attaches to your phone and can be conveniently carried anywhere.</p><p>Second, it’s important to get the right settings for your phone. In the sound settings make sure you have the microphone gain on the highest setting and the audio compression level to low. This will help capture the best quality sound possible.</p><p>Third, when you’re ready to record, make sure you are in a quiet environment. This will help minimize background noise. You can also use a pop filter or a foam windscreen to help keep wind and plosives from hurting your recording.</p><p>Finally, record a few takes and make sure to regularly check the sound levels on your phone. If you are using a mic, also check your input levels to make sure you’re not clipping. With this, you’ll be able to capture the best quality sound for your voice recordings on your Samsung Android device.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XnQ0Ucu9x0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How do I enable voice recording on my Samsung Android device?
