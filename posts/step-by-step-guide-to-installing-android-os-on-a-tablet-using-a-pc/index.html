After that, you need to create a bootable USB memory stick by using a software such as Rufus. Next, you need to connect your tablet to your computer using a USB cable and then select the Boot from USB option from the BIOS menu. Once you have done that, the Android OS will be installed on your tablet. Finally, you need to properly configure the Android OS and your tablet is ready to go.</p><h3 id=2-download-the-os>2. Download the OS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-download-the-os>#</a></h3><p>The first step in installing the Android OS on a tablet using a PC is to download the Android OS software package from the manufacturer’s website. After downloading the software package, open the zip file, and extract the software package to a folder. Once the folder is saved, open the folder, and launch the Android OS .exe file inside the folder. The Android OS installation will start, and the installation steps will be shown on the screen.</p><p>The second step is to select the preferred language, and then agree to the terms and conditions. Once the language and terms are accepted, the installation will proceed to the next step. In this step, the user will be asked to select the partition on the tablet where the OS must be installed. Select the partition as ‘disk 0 partition 1’ and click ‘Next’.</p><p>The third step is to select the type of installation. The user should select the default option, which is ‘Typical’ and click ‘Next’. This will install the Android OS on the tablet. The fourth step is to click on the ‘Install’ button. After finishing the installation process, the user will be shown a ‘Finish’ button. Click the ‘Finish’ button, and the Android OS installation on the tablet using PC is now complete.</p><h3 id=3-install-the-os-on-the-tablet>3.
