This helps ensure that no data is lost in the event of any technical issue.\nOnce both devices are prepped and ready, ensure both phones are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Then, create a folder on each device to store the data during the transfer. Using the same method for both phones, create a folder in the internal storage. Doing this helps to make sure that the data transfer is quick and easy.\n2. Steps to Transfer Files from Android to Android. Before you begin transferring files from an Android device to another, it is important to ensure that you are properly prepared. First, double check that you have the necessary cables for the transfer. Then, ensure that both Android devices are unlocked and connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Additionally, make sure that you have enough storage space on both devices to accommodate for the files you will be transferring. Finally, be sure that you have backed up the data on both devices before you start the transfer process.\n3. Final Checklist for File Transfer Completion. Transferring files from one android device to another can seem like a daunting task. However, it is actually quite easy. Before beginning, it is important to make sure that both android devices are charged and that the necessary cables are on hand.
